This work is part of an ongoing research based on the integration of biometrics and blockchain technologies [BLOCKCHAIN_2019] [ArXiv_2020]. In this last paper [ArXiv_2020], we experimentally study the key tradeoffs involved in that integration, namely, latency, processing time, economic cost, and biometric performance. 

# ON-CHAIN FACE RECOGNITION MATCHING

In addition to the analysis of the economic costs and performance of biometric templates protection schemes included in this article, another major contribution is the **implementation of some native face recognition schemes in a blockchain**. Specifically, they are designed for face biometrics, and based on **Euclidean (unprotected case) and Hamming distances (protected cases)**.

***Euclidean distance***: The implementation of this operation as a smart contract is specially challenging, due to the lack of native support for floating point arithmetic. To overcome this limitation, we represent decimal numbers as integers (i.e.: 1.12 as 112) and use the Newton-Raphson method to obtain the nth-root of d by solving the equation x^n - d = 0 iteratively.

In this way, we can also adjust the cost of the operation according to the required precision. The results show that the cost of the calculation of a square root is 23,209 gas units, and 31,304 (around 0.000031 ETH or $0.00527 for the current ether price, March 2020) for the calculation of a complete matching operation.

At first glance it may seem a small value, but in a real biometric system, the matching operation must be repeated hundreds or thousands of times. For example, for a scenario with 10,000 users, the total cost for the matching operation (the authentication of each user in the system) would be slightly greater than $50. Possible solutions and improvements will be object of future research, as discussed inside the article [ArXiv_2020].

***Hamming distance***: On the other hand, Hamming distance is significantly easier to implement and, it is virtually free in economic terms.

Every operation implemented in a blockchain must be optimized as much as possible. In this case we use an algorithm whose running time depends on the number of ones present in the binary form of the given number, instead of just traversing and counting the number of ones, obtaining a much better performance.

In contrast to the Euclidean distance, this distance calculation is simpler, and only uses bitwise operations. In addition, it does not store data into the blockchain and, as a result, as a read-only operation has no execution costs. This is especially important in a biometric scenario, where a large number of users can be involved in matching operations.
